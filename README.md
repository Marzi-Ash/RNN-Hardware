The zip file contains vivado project of this code. In case of failure in running the vivado project, you can make a vivado project using all the codes. 
There will raise an error for unidentified some instances like mult_inst and all of the instances in memory_inst (maybe you will see others based on the vivado you are using). An IP should be assignede to these instances like the image attached.
